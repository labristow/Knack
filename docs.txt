Hello,

Thank you for joining us for the first round of interviews, we had a good time chatting with you. The next step would be to complete the following assignment:

Using React, create a responsive web-app (front-end) for an Employee where they can:
Find a directory of all employees in their company
Sort the directory based on a list of attributes (anything you want like Department, Position, Location, etc)
Schedule meetings with other employees based on their availability
Use survey builder to build their own custom surveys and share with other employees to fill out

Judging criteria will be based on:
Completing the features
Mobile responsiveness
Clean code
Modern UI: How appealing and easy on the eye is the app
Great UX: How long / How easy it takes to understand and navigate the app 

Brownie points if you set up the back-end too on Node.js and consume an API that lists the employee data.

Kindly submit the assignment via a github link (or similar) + live link of the web app.

The last day to complete the assignment is Sunday 27th of June.
